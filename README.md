# toy_models

Didactic scripts for methods in computational neuroscience.

- *test_modulation.xxx* is a stand-alone script for detecting a common modulation in a time series, which introduces basic concepts such as null model, shuffling surrogates and multiple-hypothesis testing (python and matlab available)
- *estimate_directed_connectivity.xxx* is a stand-alone script for comparing the estimation between directed and undirected connectivity (python and matlab available)
- the folder *main_code_non_linear* contains scripts in matlab for non-linear connectivity analysis
- *validation_schemes.py* is a python script to introduce concepts about cross-validation in machine learning (use the environment file *brain_conn_stats.yml* to sort out dependencies with anaconda)
- *classif_pipeline.py* is a python script to identify a task performed by subjects from recording of their fMRI functional connectivity in *FC_emp_movie.npy* (use the environment file *brain_conn_stats.yml* to sort out dependencies with anaconda)
